The ODataNetworkClient provides a Swift API that interacts with the Mako App Engine Case REST API. It converts the JSON payloads to Swift struct models and determines whether or not the app can used cached file resources, or if it must download them from the Case API.
 
The Case API is an OData API, which is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming REST APIs. It enables creation of REST-based services which allow resources identified using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and defined in a data model, to be published and edited by Web clients using simple HTTP messages.
 
OData helps applications to focus on business logic without worrying about the various API approaches to define request and response headers, status codes, HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats, query options, etc. It provides guidance for tracking changes, defining functions/actions for reusable procedures, and sending asynchronous/batch requests.
 
All endpoints require an OAuth access bearer token.
 
The list of supported REST resources is defined in MM_12-IDD-87.
