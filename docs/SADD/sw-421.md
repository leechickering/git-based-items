### Description
The proprietary library that coordinates REST API calls to the Mako App Engine, retrieves and manages asset files for the Mako Plan based on the user's available disk space, formats data (including decimal numbers, deformities, laxities, angulation, and resection values) in the same way the Mako controller displays the data.
 
MyMakoData library is the primary interface for the UI's interaction with Case and Mako Plan data. It uses another proprietary library, StrykerDB, to securely persist cases information.
 
Additionally, the MyMakoData library handles detecting, logging, and notifying the user about network and data failures. It performs a caching function, allowing the application to be used for a limited time while the device is offline or has no connectivity to the Mako App Engine REST API. It is responsible for enforcing the data retention policy.
