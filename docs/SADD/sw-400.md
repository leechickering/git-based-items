Patient data within the application shall be persisted in an encrypted form using StrykerDB and the user's device biometrics, and/or password.
Data shall be retained by the application until the device disk storage becomes full, or the case is no longer available from the Mako App Engine. If the disk storage becomes full, data will be deleted from the application to increase disk space.
Â 
The application will retrieve any missing data from the Mako App Engine in the event that the persisted data becomes deleted before the case has been completed.
