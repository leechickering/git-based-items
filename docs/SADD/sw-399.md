The Application is architected in a modular structure, where components are logically separated and have well-defined interfaces. This allows for individual components to be tested in isolation simplfying test setup, and reducing dependencies. The main interface is provided by the Apple Vision Pro or iPhone hardware (and their respective operating systems) are all that is needed to test the application.
Unit tests and integration tests are based on the Apple XCTest framework are also used to support automated component and regression tests.
