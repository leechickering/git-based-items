The Splash Loader View is the main entry point for the application and provides an interstitial UI for the application to initialize its database, check with the Stryker Health Cloud to determine if the user's access to the app needs to be refreshed or has been revoked and either display the Authentication View (if the user requires authentication) or the Home View (iPhone) / Case List (Vision Pro) if the user has a valid, existing authentication session.
Â 
The Splash Loader View software unit is responsible for observing the user's authentication status as provided (and managed) by the StrykerAuth library and displaying either the Authentication View or one of the post-authentication views (Home, Case List, Plan View, or Settings) when the status changes. The Splash Loader View unit will continue to observe the authentication status even when the interstitial UI is no longer visible on the screen.
