The Authentication View provides the UI for the User to initiate the authentication process. The Authentication View uses the industry-standard Auth0 API and UI provided by Apple which displays an embedded web browser that the Application has no control over. The Authentication view invokes the StrykerAuth library to present the web view when the "Sign In" button is selected. The StrykerAuth library displays authentication errors returned by the Auth0 provider (if any) and dismisses the web view after authentication has completed successfully.
